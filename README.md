# Social Olivetti Web API

EIT Digital DeepHack - Olivetti - Trento/Italy - 1st Place (October 2019)

Project created for the first international hackathon, Social Olivetti is a solution that integrates the Olivetti API with one of the largest communication tools on the planet, WhatsApp, creating not only a chatbot using security and validation techniques but also a software that serves as an alternative to complex and difficult to handle apps, drastically lowering the learning curve for merchants.

With Social Olivetti, merchants will be able to receive notifications and set up and customize the features of the cash machines. They will also be able to control their business as a whole, always in a simple way and without the need to download any other tool/app, democratizing the use for everybody.

Basically, our goal is to turn back and raise with technology the merchant's focus on what matters most: his business.
